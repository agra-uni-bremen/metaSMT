This Project is a wrapper around various SMT or SMT-like solvers.
This means you are able to program against this library and use any
of the implemented solvers.

== Building metaSMT ==

0. Preparations
1. Install solver backends
2. Configure metaSMT
3. Build and test


0. Preparations
==================

You need: a C/C++ Compiler (tested: gcc or recent clang), make, cmake, wget,
most of them you can install from your package manager.

If you want to use the SMT-LIB2 file backend, please ensure that you have
installed bzip2 development packages (libbz2-dev on Debian-based systems).
Otherwise boost will be build without iostreams and you will get linking
errors. This is not required to use metaSMT in general.


1. The bootstrap.sh script
=============================

The bootstrap.sh script provided by metaSMT can automatically download and
install dependencies needed by metaSMT and setup a metaSMT build folder.

Calling ./bootstrap.sh without arguments will display a complete list of
options. It is recommended to call either

 ./bootstrap.sh --deps deps/ --free -m RELEASE build/
or
 ./bootstrap.sh --deps deps/ --non-free -m RELEASE build/

to download and build all dependencies in the "deps" folder and configure a
metaSMT build in the "build" folder. This folder can be shared for different
build folders. The parameters --free and --non-free select which set of
backend tools to download and include in the build, you need to select which
you want.

Please note that some free and non-free backends use licenses which
are not compatible (e.g. Boolector: GPL, SWORD and Z3: Proprietary).
Check the compatibility of the selected backends with your own projects
licence.

If your system does not provide a recent version of cmake, bootstrap.sh can
build a local version when provided with "--cmake".

2. Build metaSMT
===================

An already configured "build" folder can be build using

  cd build
  make

and installed (optional, only when used as external library) using

  make install

If no install folder is given to bootstrap.sh by default metaSMT is installed
to the build/root/ folder.

Please also note that metaSMT by default compiles an excessive test suite for
all available backends. After building it can be called with "make test".
However building the suite can take a lot of time. If you want to disable
building the tests you can call

  cmake ./ -DmetaSMT_ENABLE_TESTS=off

or by setting the option using "ccmake ." or "cmake-gui .".

3. Using metaSMT
===================

The toolbox folder provides an easy way to use metaSMT in your own code.
Just create a subfolder and start writing a program. All C++ code will
automatically build into an executable. The folder contains a separate README
and some examples using metaSMT.

4. Documentation
==================

In addition to the examples, the API documentation is located in the doc/html/
folder. Simply open the doc/html/index.html file in your favorite browser.
Note: The documentation is not yet complete. Only selected modules are
currently documented.
